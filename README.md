# Cloud-resume-challenge
 
I completed this project after starting a training course by Adrian Cantrilo for the AWS Solutions Architect certification.  Watching videos is ok, but I like to learn by doing and this was a very challenging project that I knew would require many hours looking at documentation. As I didn't know much code at that point, I chose to use a pre-built HTML/CSS template for the frontend. Loading the website triggers an AWS Lambda function that increases the visitor count in a DynamoDB table by one and returns the new count to the website.

This project contained many firsts for me, such as the use of the Serverless Application Model CLI tool, and creation of an AWS Lambda function. I spent numerous research hours online as I worked towards completion of the website and its backend counter. I attempted to write the Lambda code myself, but ended up referencing several other similar functions to piece together a working solution.

The project is mostly complete, but I still need to add a CI/CD pipeline which I am going to do, but I want to take a short break and switch gears to Docker and Kubernetes and Terraform for a bit. I have learned quite a bit more about coding and about the way these services function and work together. It would be an interesting exercise to see if I could author the Lambda function on my own at this point.
